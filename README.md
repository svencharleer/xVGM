# xVGM
xVGM is an attempt to create a standard for open video game metrics for researchers, game developers, and players based on the xAPI standard.

First attempt using the League of Legends websocket data to convert game metrics to xVGM. We invite everyone to improve the conversion and support different games.

*LOL_convert.py:* converts file input file (e.g. fox_tl_enhanced.json) to xVGM output (example: output.json)

## From the paper
Gameplay Metrics can help provide insights into player behaviour and performance, supporting game designers and players wishing to better understand their own game, yet such data is often not easily available to the wider public. We take our inspiration from the field of Learning Analytics, which attempts to create awareness and insights for learners by leveraging the gathered activity data and feeding this back to the students in an open way. This paper suggests an open standard for gathering and storing Gameplay Metrics data based on proven standards in Learning Analytics, facilitating easier development of analytical tools across different video games and genres to the benefit of researchers, developers, and players.
